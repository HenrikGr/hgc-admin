 * Description:
 *
 * GENERAL
 * Reducers are pure JavaScript functions that:
 * - Create a new state, given the current state and an action
 * - Centralize data mutations
 * - Can act on all or part of the state
 * - Can be combined and reused
 *
 * Because they're pure functions, reducers have no side effects,
 * so they're easy to read, test, and debug. And you can compose reducers,
 * which makes it easy to implement simple reducers that are concerned
 * with only a portion of the overall application state.
